<!-- abora:header_close -->

		<p>The thinking behind the Abora project, and the design and code
		on which it is based is strongly influenced, and in cases built
		upon, the work of the following individuals. Without their efforts,
		this project would still be an idle dream of the author.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><b>Ted Nelson</b> for his deep insights and tenacious
			enthusiasm for hypertext systems as exhibited by the Xanadu
			system. His writings have proven a corner stone of my own
			efforts with Abora.</li>

			<li>All the <B>XOC folks</b> for their detailed thinking on
			hypertext issues and the resulting Udanax-Gold and Udanax-Green
			implementations together with their subsequent open-sourcing in
			1999. This gracious act has allowed me to learn a lot from their
			design, and the code of Gold has formed the basis of my own
			Abora-White subproject.</li>

			<li><b>Jeff Rush</b> for his Sunless-Sea website and private
			email which has been a critical medium for learning about the
			Udanax implementations.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Many thanks to all of you.</p>


		<p>A number of open-source and free-price tools and services have
		been instrumental in developing this application.</p>

		<ul>

			<li><b>SourceForge</b> for hosting the website and the
			development tools such as CVS, mail and bugs.</li>

			<li><b>Eclipse</b> IDE used for the Java sub-projects.</li>

			<li><b>Ant</b> build tool.</li>

		</ul>
