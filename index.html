      <h1>Abora Hypermedia Project</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->


			<p>Abora is an ongoing project to implement and nurture
			information systems that enable individuals and groups to create
			a rich literature of long lived works. The interconnected nature
			of documents will be supported from the core up through quoting
			and fine-grained typed links. Collaboration of individuals
			across time by concurrent modifications, strong versioning,
			refined change notifications, and external commenting.
			Extensible first-class document types from text to movies to
			structured research data. Resilient, adaptive and relevant
			implementations that will cope with and last for a lifetime of
			use. All-in-one solutions and generic server with API will be
			released under open-source licenses.</p>

			<p>Current work on the project is strongly influenced by the
			ideas of <a href="http://ted.hyperland.com/">Ted Nelson</a> as articulated in his Xanadu
			hypermedia project, and also the design and implementation of
			<a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> by <a href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a>.</p>

			<p>A number of sub-projects exploring these aims are documented
			on this website. A limited demo was written in Summer 2002 that
			gives a flavour for some of the core features.</p>

		Smalltalk source into Java source code. The resulting Java code is compilable, and
		a small number of tests run, but it is still a long way from being a production grade
		system. The generated Java, with hand crafted supporting code, is being called
		Abora-Gold for the moment until a final name is resolved.<br>

				Udanax-Gold server. This started from the result of a far earlier
				version of the Udanax-Gold2Java translator, that at the time only 
				generated "approximate" java (7000+ compliation errors). Starting from
				this non-working Java code, the goal was to create a compilable, working
				version that aligned with standard Java idioms. With the significant
				progress subsequently made with the Udanax-Gold2Java translator, the
				Abora-White project has been abandoned. The hand code test cases, and
				porting of the primitive array classes may still be useful for the
				translator.<br><a

		<td><b>Udanax-Gold2Dolphin</b> <font color="gray">[<font
		color="red">Aborted</font> 2001]</font><br> First attempt by the
		author to investigate the Udanax-Gold code. The source was loaded
		into Dolphin Smalltalk and tweaked enough to allow most of the
		existing tests to run a little. Major roadblocks were from missing
		code, and the guesses that were made to make for those gaps. The
		result of this project was never packaged up for distribution, but
		source could be made available on request.<br> <a
