<!-- abora:header_close -->

		<p>The <i>UdanaxGold2Java</i> project contains a number of
		sub-components related to converting the released <a
		href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">Udanax-Gold</a> Smalltalk and
		C++ source code by <a href="http://www.udanax.com/">XOC</a> into
		Java source code. The aim is to provide a first pass automatic
		translation of as much of the code as possible. The end result is
		<b>not</b> compilable but may prove useful for non-Smalltalk users
		who are interested in reading the Udanax-Gold source code. See the
		Abora-White project for a working implementation based on the
		result of this project.</p>

		<p>This project is split up into three sections:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The <a href="#udanax-gold">udanax-gold</a> sub-directory contains a number of
			fragments of the Udanax-Gold source as supplied by XOC. This
			code was released under a MIT open-source licence.</li>

			<li>The <a href="#translator">translator</a> sub-directory implements a simple Java
			translator that is used to automatically convert from the
			Udanax-Gold Smalltalk source to (approximately) Java - though
			with lots of remaining compilation problems.</li>

			<li>The <a href="#abora-gold">abora-gold</a> sub-directory holds the Java
			translation of the Udanax-Gold code. This includes the result of
			the translator application and some hand coded translated
			classes from C++ code plus some place-holder classes for source
			that has not been released by XOC yet but is referenced by
			translated source.</li>

<h3>Udanax-Gold</h3>

		<p>The <b>Udanax-Gold</b> sub-component contains the source code
		which is the input to the translator.

		<p>A number of files are present here as it has been a struggle to
		find a complete set of Udanax-Gold source files. All the following
		files were originally from XOC but the author acquired them from a number of
		locations. I believe all are supplied under XOC open-source
		licence which is based on the very liberal MIT licence.</p>

		<p>It seems that there are still a number of classes from the
		original that have not yet been released as there are a number of
		classes referenced from the source that aren't present in the
		following files. This is probably due to either outdated
		references, "foreign entanglements" with copyrighted system code
		or they have somehow gone missing in the release process. At this
		moment it's not apparent whether the missing classes are
		significant enough to interfere with later translation efforts. If
		anybody has access to any additional source then please get in
		contact. </p>


<p><b>udanax-top.st</b><br>

This is the principle Udanax-Gold source released by XOC. It is the core
			of the system and includes the Ent and Coordinate-Space systems
			as well as Work/Edition and Front-End wrappers.<br>
<a href="http://www.udanax.com/gold/">http://www.udanax.com/gold/</a></p>

These are additional Smalltalk source files found on Les Tyrrell's
			website. The bulk of these files are very Smalltalk specific,
			but they do prove very interesting in learning the secrets
			behind the Fluid system, plus the critical Heaper class which is
			the root of the vast majority of the core Udanax-Gold classes.<br>

<p><b>c.zip</b><br>

Collection of X++ (the XOC dialect of C++) source which has proven

<h3>Translator</h3>

<p>The Translator is a small Java app to automatically translate from the
<b>Udanax-Gold</b> Smalltalk(ish) source code into Java.</p>

<p>Translating from Smalltalk source code to Java code is normally a
very difficult proposition as Smalltalk source does not include
declared types. Thankfully as a requirement for XOCs own translator to
X++, their variant of C++, the typing information is present in the
source code. Unfortunately there are a number of complications; still
a lot of work to carry out without that much information on what the
X++ translator did, plus the features and restrictions of Java aren't
a perfect match for X++, one example is the stricter handling of
statics in Java and the inability to have an instance and static
method of the same class with the same signature.</p>
			
<p>The Abora-White project was the result of an earlier run of the translator,
which only produced semi-compilable java code, which was then "finished" by hand.
As the translator can now produce compilable code for the majority of the Smalltalk
source, the Abora-White project is now deprecated.</p>

<h4>Using the Translator</h4>

<p>The easiest route to using the Translator is the Ant <tt>build.xml</tt> file
present in this directory.</p>

<p>Once you have Java JDK 1.4+, Ant 1.5.1+, JUnit 3.8.1 set up, just run
the following from the command line:</p>

<tt>&gt; <b>ant</b></tt>

<p>You should see some logging info summarising the walk through of a
number of source Smalltalk files, and a larger number of generated
Java files. The process should take less than a minute on a reasonable
machine. You should find approximately 500 classes generated.</p>

<p>The generated Java files are placed in <tt>../abora-gold/src-gen directory</tt>
under the <tt>org.abora.gold</tt> Java package. </p>


<h4>Translator Examples</h4>

		<p>The best way to sample the result of the translator is simply
		to look at the resulting code in the <tt>src-gen</tt> directory.
		As a quick introduction I have included a few examples from the
		<tt>org.abora.ug2java.translator.tests</tt> package to give a
		flavour for the basic transformations that are used.</p>

		<p>Note the formatting has been manually modified from the
		original text of each for easier reading. In practice the results
		of auto-translation should be passed separately through an
		automatic tidying process.</p>

<h4>Extending the Translator</h4>

<p>Good Luck! This code was meant to be a throw away weekend project but
I had to end up extending it quite significantly. Still there isn't
too much code here, and there is some test coverage of the in-method
transformations.</p>

<p>The JUnit tests are present in the <tt>org.abora.ug2java.tests.TestWriteMethod</tt>
class, and can be run courtesy of ant:</p>

<tt>&gt; <b>ant test</b></tt>


		<p><tt>TranslateSmalltalk.main(...)</tt> is the entry point of the
		application taking an output directory, and one or more source
		Smalltalk files to process.</p>

		<tt>&gt; <b>java org.abora.ug2java.TranslateSmalltalk outputDir udanax-top.st</b></tt>

		<p>The Smalltalk files are stored in a version of the classic
		Smalltalk Chunk format which effectively has a sequence of chunks
		of text with a terminating exclamation mark (!). A chunk can
		define a new class, define a method of a specific method category
		and arbitrary Smalltalk expressions. More than one class can be
		defined in each source file.</p>

<p>There are two major passes over the source by TranslateSmalltalk.</p>

<p>The first pass reads in each of the Smalltalk source files in turn.
For each included class a <tt>ClassWriter</tt> is created and initialised with
its name, superclass, etc. Also each related chunk is read and either
added to the classWriter as a simple comment or an instance or static
method. The Java package of a class is based on its Smalltalk class
category, and is recorded for each class so that appropriate Java
import statements can be generated later.</p>

<p>The second pass walks through each <tt>ClassWriter</tt> requesting it to write
out a suitable .java file for itself. At this point each of its methods
is translated into Java and written out as part of the class
definition.</p>

<p>The Smalltalk source for a method is parsed using a <tt>SmalltalkScanner</tt>
which returns a series of <tt>ScannerTokens</tt>. These are simple token
interpretation of the Smalltalk with type and value. This series of
ScannerTokens is in turn converted into a sequence of sub-instances of
<tt>JavaToken</tt>. A series of <tt>transformX</tt> methods then walk the sequence of
Java tokens applying suitable transformations to move things closer to
the desired form. One transformation is to remove references to self
if necessary, another converts create(...) method calls to a
constructor call for the appropriate class.</p>

<p>Writing out a text version of the Java tokens is accomplished by
simply visiting each token in turn and appending to the current method
output. No effort is expended to indent statements correctly and also
some extra spaces will be inserted against standard Java formatting.
Additionally the original Smalltalk source is appended at the end of
the method together with the file and line number from where it came
to help with further manual corrections as may be needed later.</p>


<h4>Future Translator Improvements</h4>

<p>I'm not sure how much further effort I am going to expend on the
translator, but considering the level of Java compilation problems
present in the translation code there is scope for lots of
improvements :-)</p>

<ul>
		<li>Bugs trying to find beginning of expression</li>
		<li>Bracketting if/while expressions</li>
		<li>Convert more of the block cases; DiskManager.consistent, forEach,
etc</li>
		<li>Use Java abstract method/class support</li>
		<li>Cast if appropriate to result of make(...) calls</li>
		<li>Sort out <tt>IntegerVar</tt>/<tt>BooleanVar</tt> support, which may require working out
the type of fields and calls to make up for lack of C++ operator
overloading for converting between these classes and primitives and
equivalents of primitive operations such as +</li>
		<li>Indent resulting Java code rather than relying on an external source
formatter to be applied against the generated code</li>
		<li>Converting to a more standard parse tree may clear up some of the
code</li>
		<li>Try and define the transformations as parse-tree modifications in a
Refactoring or XLST fashion rather than existing primitive Java code</li>
		<li>Gain documents for XOCs own translator to C++ for a better handle
on what should be happening - for example class attributes such as ON.CLIENT</li>
		<li>Tidying up the code!</li>
		</ul>

<h3>Abora-Gold</h3>


<p>Abora-Gold is just my name for the combination of auto and manual
translation from the Udanax-Gold open-source released by XOC. It is
<b>not</b> compilable but my prove useful for non-Smalltalk users who are
interested in reading the Udanax-Gold source code.</p>

<p>There are two source directories present.</p>

<p><b>src</b> is the location for the code which I manually translated from
X++ for PrimArray and subclasses - this is broken. Additionally there
are a number of place-holder classes for classes which haven't seen to
have been released yet by XOC.</p>

<p><b>src-gen</b> is the location of the classes auto-translated from
Smalltalk by my translator. It will only be present if you have run
the translator.</p>

		<p>The base class of the UG Smalltalk source is typically
		<tt>Heaper</tt>, plus a few of the Smalltalk specific lower-level
		implementation directly subclass <tt>Object</tt>. The Heaper class
		is translated to <tt>org.abora.gold.xpp.basic.Heaper</tt>, but
		this subclasses from a made up
		<tt>org.abora.gold.java.AboraHeaper</tt> class rather than Object.
		The AboraHeaper class is the superclass for <b>all</b> Abora
		classes, and is used to hold a few methods that XOC added to the
			Smalltalk Object class and inherited, and also introduces the names
		of fluid variables in a non-functional way.</p>

		<p>There are a number of classes referenced from the supplied XOC
		source that don't appear to be defined. Place holder classes with
		matching names were created under the
		<tt>org.abora.gold.java.missing</tt> package and sub-packages.
		These have been split up into application, handle and Smalltalk
		packages.</p>

		<p>Earlier work to import the XOC Smalltalk source into Dolphin
		Smalltalk, followed by a focus on running the XOC tests, indicated
		that the basic collection classes were missing. These are vital
		for running the tests, and are widely referenced. An alternative
		source of the basic collection classes was acquired from some X++
		sources and are present in the
		<tt>org.abora.gold.collection.basic</tt> package. These are again
		place holder implementation, except that the public method
		definitions have also been added. See Abora-White for a working
		implementation of these classes.</p>
