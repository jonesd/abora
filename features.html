      <h1>Abora Features</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->

		<p>The Abora hypertext system is intended to be composed of a
		server component, client API and a variety of client applications
		demonstrating the capabilities of the server. The server provides
		a sophisticated and general data management system. Some examples
		of its use could be as the core of a dynamic web-site, or as a
		document server for a company network, or even as the repository
		for a lifetime of personal notes, references and writings. </p>

		<p>The following gives a brief summary of some of the tasks and
		uses that Abora will be able to help with:</p>

		<ul>

			<li>Heavy re-working of documents - flexible version support,
			visualisation of changes and inclusion of shared content</li>

			<li>Peer review of documents - categorised discussions on
			specific sections of content with filtering based on user and
			open associated tag information.</li>

			<li>Informal working groups - notification of document changes
			and new links enables spontaneous groups to form around specific
			documents as needed.</li>

			<li>Richly related documents - sophisticated linking and sharing
			of content between documents and versions enables a literature
			of works to be written and used.</li>

			<li>Distributed deployments - Multiple servers allows documents
			to be replicated for performance, reliability and easier access.

			<li>Secure and controlled document access - user and groups
			enable flexible access to documents and integrated cryptography
			improves confidence of authorship and original contents.</li>

			<li>Long lived documents - document identity, sponsorship and
			distributed garbage collection keeps documents in the system as
			long as required, and can continue to be found and accurately
			referenced even after day-to-day modification.</li>

			<li>Beyond text support - all the above capabilities can apply
			to images, sound, movies and other arbitrary types of
			content.</li>

      </ul>

      
      <h3>Xanalogical Features</h3>
      
      <p>The core Abora features are inspired by Xanadu and derive
      from the capabilities of the underlying Ent data structure as
      present in Udanax-Gold.</p>

      <ul>

			<li><b>Transclusions</b> or virtual-copies can be seen as a form
			of quoting except the quote is still connected back to the
			original text so it is always possible to find the original
			author of any character of text, and all other documents that
			share the same content. This helps against the problems of
			quoting out-of-context, and taking benefit from some-one elses
			work without proper acknowledgement.</li>

			<li>Implemented on top of this is support for <b>fine-grained
			links</b> that are typed and can be navigated in both
			directions. Links can be stored separate from the content itself
			to enable anyone to annotate any other document that they can
			view. In combination with typed links this enables low-overhead
			commenting of original text and structured responses such as
			refutations, agreements, acknowledgements. Links can also be
			filtered by users to focus on comments from respected or
			specific viewpoints. This will be a critical feature once
			hundreds or thousands of links have been attached to a
			document.</li>

			<li><b>Coordinate space</b> mechanism allows content elements to
			be mapped over more sophisticated spaces than that of text or
			uncompressed audio. One possibility is the two dimensions of an
			uncompressed image. This enables transclusions and links to work
			across these numerous spaces, for example just the eye of an
			image of a face could be transcluded into a separate document,
			and a destination of a link could be to a few seconds of a sound
			sample.</li>

			<li><b>Sensors</b> or detectors can be attached to objects to
			learn when certain actions occur. Some examples includes
			detecting when a new link is added to an interesting document,
			or when a new edition of a document is made. This can enable the
			spontaneous grouping of interested parties around a central
			document that acts as focus for the work.</li>

			<li>These features are all tied into a <b>version system</b>
			that ensures links stay connected to their original content and
			transcluded content stays available. Modifications to documents
			are stored at the level of changes initiated by the user, so
			between editions changes can be copying and moving in addition
			to the more primitive deletes and inserts that systems such as
			CVS would break user level changes down to.</li>

			<li>A significant force that shaped the Udanax-Gold design was
			the need for an implementation that could expand up to a
			<b>distributed system</b> comparable to todays World-Wide-Web.
			There is an interesting mix of mutable and immutable state that
			enables replication of data, together with idea of sponsors of
			documents and a distributed garbage collection system to ensure
			that documents are only removed from the system once they aren't
			referenced anymore or no-one is prepared to provide sufficient
			space for them.</li>

      </ul>
	
      <h3>Downsides</h3>

      <p>The features list summarises a series of very interesting
      differences against the standard WWW or even the innumerable
      custom web-site implementations. Given all this good news, what
      should one be concerned about?</p>

      <ul>

			<li><b>Complexity</b> of the implementation is significantly
			higher than was found during the birth of the WWW. This has
			implications both to the time it will take to write a
			production-grade version of the server, and to the complexity
			and level of knowledge required by programmers that are
			interested in writing or extending clients. Where as any
			programmer could code up HTTP clients and servers on a whim,
			just writing a compatible Abora client will be a significant
			undertaking. Once the project has stabalized, producing well
			documented versions of the API with ample examples will be an
			important force on the greater success of the project.</li>

			<li><b>Server reliance</b> is a constraint on the use of
			clients. A client needs to be in relatively frequent
			communication with a server, both to find content, but also
			during modification of content as the server essentially acts as
			a repository and needs to be informed precisely of higher level
			actions such as copying text between two locations. Contrast
			this to the use of CVS and a text editor; a CVS client is used
			to download a text document from the CVS repository, but then
			any text editor can make as many changes as it likes before
			eventually committing the new revision of the document back to
			the CVS server. It is only at this point that the server
			attempts to calculate the users changes, which will be encoded
			up as primitive actions such as inserts and deletes. This
			frequent communication with the server for Abora clients can be
			mitigated by running a server on each machine. The other effect
			though is that clients have to understand the Abora protocol,
			whereas the text editor knows nothing of CVS, as far as it is
			concerned it is just opening and saving text documents from the
			local filing system, and is oblivious to the CVS client which
			moves files to and from the external CVS server. An Abora client
			does have to know about Abora, and even with efforts to ease
			this communication with well documented APIs it will be a
			significant challenge to the quantity of clients created and
			extended to support the Abora server.</li>

			<li><b>Performance</b> was a driving factor in the earlier
			development of Xanadu solutions, especially given the dreams of
			a world spanning system of interconnected servers. These efforts
			should enable the performance of the system to grow within a
			sustainable rate as data and servers are added. Other than
			question marks over sufficient analysis of the entire system to
			confirm these hopes, there might be the more pressing concern of
			performance in the small rather than the large. There are
			significant basic costs for operations and storage to implement
			the sophisticated linking, versioning and other capabilities. It
			is unknown quite how large this constant overhead is at this
			stage.</li>
