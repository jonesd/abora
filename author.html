		<p>All work so far under the Abora project banner has been
			accomplished by David Jones. I can't claim any connection with the
			long history of the Xanadu project, but was aware in passing of
			Ted Nelsons work and the shadow of the Xanadu project. I was
			fascinated to read the much maligned Wired article, but finally
			started to get an inkling of the value of a Xanadu like system
			after reading <i>Literary Machines</i> followed by some brief
			investigations into the open-source release of Udanax-Gold.</p>

			<p>If you are interested in contributing, or have any comments
			then don't hesitate to contact the author.</p>
