    <h1>Abora Applications</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->

			<p>The Abora server will provide a document server that focuses
			on the connections between content and their changes. A number
			of interesting and unusual capabilities arise from the design.
			These apply at a relatively low level, and it can be confusing
			to relate these new possibilities with applications that make
			full use of them.</p>

			<p>The aim of this page is to highlight a number of possible
			applications that could gain from using an Abora server.
			Extensions to existing well known applications and services will
			be sketched out, together with potential new applications. The
			hope is to help answer the question, "but what can you do with
			these neat features?"</p>

<h3>Extending An Existing Wiki Server</h3>

			<p>The family of Wiki web servers are one of the more
			interesting examples of websites supporting collaboration. They
			are based on the initially improbable idea of having open access
			to write and modify any of the text on a page, and create new
			pages. One can edit an exiting page, inserting your comments
			into someone else's original text, or even rewriting it. Wikis
			succeed due to their simplicity and freedom to comment and
			rework.</p>

			<p>The simplest view is tha an Abora server should provide
			enough capabilities to allow one to write a stardard wiki web
			server that could serve web browsers.</p>

			<p>The family of Wiki servers ranges from versions created in an
			evening from a few short Perl scripts, to pretty sophisticated
			implementations with JavaScript text editors, XML access and
			other features.</p>

			<p>Starting from the relatively well known area of Wikis, what
			kind of additional features or changes to its abilities might an
			Abora backed implementation enable.</p>

<h4>Focused Comments</h4>

				<p>One of the typical scenarios with a wiki page is that
				someone else has written a few screens of text, and you want
				to make a comment on a couple of sentences in the middle of
				it. You would either insert a comment line at this point and
				interrupt the original flow or you could add your comment at
				the end of the original text, but you would then have to
				describe the context of your comment by referring back to the
				line or two you are commenting on before you could make the
				actual comment.</p>

				<p>With the abora server you could select the sentence you
				want to comment on, then make your comment, and under the
				covers your comment would be associated with the original
				sentence. Effectively there is a link between the sentence and
				your comment. It would then be up to the wiki server to render
				that comment in whatever way it liked; possibly an in-line
				link, or showing your comment in the margin beside the
				original sentence. Anything is possible with the rendering,
				but the critical thing is that you have tied your comment to
				the specific original text. This both saves you from having to
				describe the context due to association with original text,
				plus this relationship will survive feature editing and
				quoting by others. You could also associate a type with the
				comment, so in this case you may have thought that there was a
				mistake in the original and so your comment could be clarified
				as a correction. This provides a compact summary of the
				comment, and also allows the active reader to better filter
				additions to a page to help with numerous comments. This
				technique can also be used to build up a structured dialogue
				of pro/con arguments and references else where.</p>

<h4>Filtered Notifications</h4>

				<p>Say one is interested in "acceptance tests". Perhaps there
				is already a wiki page with this title. Most Wikis would allow
				me to set a trigger such that I receive an email if that page
				is changed. This allows me to stay up to date with documents
				and arguments that I find interesting or would like to add as
				others extend it.</p>

				<p>Extending this the Abora server would also be able to
				trigger notifications if anyone made a new link onto the
				acceptance tests page, or if someone copied-and-pasted any
				text of the acceptance tests page to another page. These
				triggers can be associated with specific parts of the page, so
				if you are interested in additional comments and modifications
				only to a certain paragraph of the page, then triggers will
				only be fired for that paragraph rather than for a change
				anywhere else on the page. You could also filter by type of
				comment, to only show agreements with a paragraph of the
				page.</p>


<h4>Comparing</h4>

				<p>Comparing different versions of the same wiki page would
				highlight changes made by users such as
				copying/moving/duplication/quoting changes as those kinds of
				things rather than just being forced down to primitive inserts
				or deletes operations.</p>

				<p>The comments that have been made to the acceptance tests
				paragraph will stay connected to it, even if the acceptance
				tests page has grown too large and people end up splitting the
				original paper into 4 separate pages. The differencing stuff
				also functions at this point, and any links that had made into
				the original page still stay valid - as the original page is
				kept - plus you will be able to move forward through the
				revisions and track the page split up and where the paragraph
				you were interested in had moved off to. Comparing the
				original whole page and one of the split off pages you would
				accurately see the text that had been split off.</p>


<h4>Beyond Text</h4>

				<p>Wikis are focused on text. The abora server, not
				implemented yet, but the udanax-gold server that is the
				inspiration for my abora work, also works for non text types.
				So I could imagine a wiki page which includes an image from an
				advertising campaign. I would now like to comment on the image
				to show how the viewers eyes moves around the page, and how
				they balanced the focus on part A of the image with B and C
				parts. Links can be made from the text description to the
				specific parts of the image. A suitable rendering could show
				that. Backfollowing links still works for images, so I could
				get all the comments on a specific part of the image, or could
				be informed if anyone modifies or linked to a specific part of
				the image. I could also create a new page focused on only a
				couple of sections of the image, so I could transclude those
				sections of the image onto my new page - so I see just the
				nose and left ear of the original face, but again the
				comparison between the full image and my two sections would
				highlight the similarities, plus anyone could backfollow from
				the sections to the original image, and comments on either
				side could be found if the comments were made on the sections.
				Another example could be a music score rather than an image,
				plus comments and quoting on sections of that musical
				score.</p>
