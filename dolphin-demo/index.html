      <h1>Dolphin Demo</h1>
<!-- abora:header_close -->

		<p><b>Dolphin Demo</b> is a Windows executable of a combined
		server and thick client that implements from scratch a limited
		subset of the Udanax-Gold capabilities. It supports fine grained
		links, versioning and differencing. Work has ceased for the moment
		while attention is focused on a Java implementation.</p>

		<h3>Implemented Features</h3>

		<p>Most of these features are just prototype grade and will
		require rework before reaching a level suitable for the end user
		in a stable, efficient hypertext system.

		<ul>
			<li>Subset of Ent implementation - integer space, no canopies, position based</li>
		  <li>Simple transclusions between content elements and Ent tree structure</li>
		  <li>Works and editions</li>
		  <li>History as frozen works</li>
		  <li>Primitive endorsements</li>
		  <li>Front-End text editor with browser on Works and editions</li>
		  <li>Comparisons between arbitary editions - styled after pyxi by Ka-Ping Ye</li>
		  <li>Links implemented by transclusions</li>
		  <li>Simple persistence by saving entire works storage as atomic operation</li>
		  <li>First pass at Fe-Be (or client/server) split</li>
		  <li>Open source</li>
		  <li>Test cases</li>
		  <li>Executable demo for Windows platform (with fancy colours!)</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>Known Problems</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>System slows down significantly for text longer than a few
			pages Prime problem here is just my un-optimized text editor
			implementation.</li>

		  <li>Infrequent balancing of Ent tree by Splaying, as my splaying
		  implementation currently duplicates too many internal
		  SplitNodes.</li>

			<li>Leaf nodes are split too often in Ent, eg on creating a link
			that doesn't match existing leaf boundaries.</li>

			<li>UI for defining and following Links is very poor and
			limiting.</li>

		</ul>
