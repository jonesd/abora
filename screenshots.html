<h3>Dolphin Demo</h3>

		<p>The <a href="http://abora.dgjones.info/dolphin-demo/index.html">Dolphin Demo</a> was developed during the Summer of 2002
		to investigate the Udanax-Gold design and explorations into
		xanalogical UIs. The result is very rough, but starts to hint at
		some of the interesting features that come out of the basic
		design.</p>

						<td><a class="screenshot" href="dolphin-demo/documents.png">
					<img src="dolphin-demo/documents-small.png" alt="main window">
				</a></td>

	    <td>The demo is centred around a simple text editor that
	    supports a number of xanalogical features. The central pane of
	    the UI is the text editor, to the left the library of known
	    works and the revisions of the currently selected work. Text can
	    be modified just as in a normal editor. Some of the standard
	    Windows mechanisms such as a copy-and-paste have been extended
	    to support transclusions, it is also possible to create new
	    works based on the current text again using a transclusion
	    mechanism.</td>

					<tr>
      <td><a href="dolphin-demo/comparison.png" class="screenshot">
					<img src="dolphin-demo/comparison-small.png" alt="document
							 comparison">
				</a></td>

	    <td>It is possible to compare the contents of the central text
	    pane with any other edition. The base edition that the central
	    text is compared against is shown in the pane to the right of
	    the window. The mechanism of this comparison is interesting as
	    it enables accurate fine grained differences to be recognised at
	    the users level. This is documented in the <a
	    href="http://www.abora.org/dolphin-demo/tech.html">Tech
	    Report</a>, but comes down to finding the similarities rather
	    than the differences between texts. The rendering shown here is
	    based on highlighting contiguous sequences of any texts that
	    exist in both editions. Each sequence is assigned a colour and
	    the background of the matching text in both editions is then
	    painted with this colour. The splitter between the texts
	    connects together matching sequences by drawing filled regions
	    between them. The value of the rendering is that it helps to
	    visualise when blocks of text have been copied, moved or even
	    duplicated. Any text that is only found in one of the editions
	    is rendered with a grey background. A further embellishment is
	    that as the text cursor moves around the main text, the matching
	    point in the compared text is brought into focus.</td>

      <td><a href="dolphin-demo/links.png" class="screenshot">
					<img src="dolphin-demo/links-small.png" alt="links list">
				</a></td>

	    <td>All of the links onto the text comprising the edition can be
	    viewed from this pane. Links are fine grained down to the level
	    of characters and may also have a type associated with them. The
	    server implementation of links is interesting as it is built out
	    of the transclusion mechanisms. One of the useful benefits of
	    this is that links can survive revisions of documents. A simple
	    typing scheme is used, so that the text tagged as being of type
	    Title can be used for the name of the work as shown in the
	    top-left pane. Another aspect of the link is whether it is
	    defined as part of this work, or defined elsewhere and is just
	    onto some of this edition's content.</td>

      <td><a href="dolphin-demo/transclusions.png" class="screenshot">

				</a></td>

	    <td>It is possible to back-follow any of the content that this
	    edition transcludes to all the other works that include the same
	    content. This can be useful to find if anyone is quoting your
	    own work, or to find other quotes or comments onto any content
	    that you are interested in or quoting in you document. The
	    extent of the content that is considered can be trimmed down to
	    just the current selection for finer grain research.</td>

				</a></td>

	    <td>Developer tool to investigate the actual ent-node structure
	    that is being used under the covers to represent the current
	    work. The top pane of the inspector shows each of the roots of
	    the ent tree, with all the children branching off towards the
	    right. The leaf nodes represent one or more characters of the
	    content. Details of each node, such as the revision it was added
	    to, and any displacement values are shown in line. The nodes of
	    the ent tree can actually be shared by multiple edition
	    revisions, which results in some nodes having multiple parents.
	    This can be investigated in the lower pane which navigates
	    root-ward from the node selected in the top pane. Each of the
	    leafs of this lower pane should correspond to a root in the top
	    pane.</td>

<h3>Udanax-Gold2Java</h3>

		<p><a href="http://abora.dgjones.info/udanax-gold2java/index.html">Udanax-Gold2Java</a> is a small throw-away command line
		application to auto-translate the Udanax-Gold Smalltalk source
		into approximate Java source.</p>

				<tr>
						<td><a class="screenshot" href="udanax-gold2java/screenshot.png">
					<img src="udanax-gold2java/screenshot-small.png" alt="ant translation">
				</a></td>

	    <td>The translation process is driven by an ant script. You feed
	    in the original Smalltalk source files from Udanax-Gold,
	    supplied with the release, and something approximating Java
	    source files will be spit out, one file per class. There are
	    about 500 or so classes in the release. These classes are
	    generated under a <tt>src-gen</tt> directory to also allow some
	    manually pre-created classes to patch up some of the wholes left
	    by the unreleased Smalltalk source code. The whole process takes
	    less than a minute on a 800mhz P3 machine.</td>
